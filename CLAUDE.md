# Jared Bangal — portfolio site

Static site. No build step, no framework, no package manager. Plain HTML, one
stylesheet, one progressive-enhancement script.

```
index.html              Home
assets/css/styles.css   all styles
assets/js/main.js       nav state, reveals, scrollspy, form validation
assets/img/             portrait.webp (801×1200) + portrait-480.webp
reference/              squarespace.com screenshots + scraped tokens
```

## Visual direction

The page follows squarespace.com's system, on Jared's dark palette.
`reference/squarespace-tokens.json` holds values scraped from their live
site — re-scrape rather than guess if you need more. What was adopted:

- **Nav** 80px, transparent over the hero, blurred translucent bar after.
- **Display type** weight 300, `letter-spacing: -.055em`, `line-height: 1.04`,
  fluid `clamp()`. This light-and-tight setting is the whole look; don't
  bold headings.
- **Labels** 12px/500 uppercase with `+.08em` tracking.
- **Buttons** 4px radius, uppercase 14px/500, solid fill, colour-and-
  background transition (no opacity fades, no lift).
- **Radii** 4px controls, 8px media/cards, 30px chips.
- **Easings**, all four lifted from their computed styles:
  `--ease-out` easeOutQuart (everything entering), `--ease-in-out`
  easeInOutCubic (buttons), `--ease-in-out-q` easeInOutQuad (nav),
  `--ease-in` easeInQuart (exits).
- **Layout** centred section heads with a muted sub-line, generous
  vertical air (128/160px section padding).

Their face, Clarkson, is licensed proprietary and served from their CDN —
do not embed or hotlink it. **Archivo** is the stand-in: closest freely
licensed grotesque with a true 300 weight.

## Source of truth

The design lives in Claude Design project
`f1dfaa4f-eab9-48d1-b16c-67b925eef288` ("Portfolio landing page design").
`Home.dc.html` there is the reference for this page; `Services.dc.html` and
`Pricing.dc.html` are designed but **not yet implemented** — `services.html`
and `pricing.html` are linked from the nav and footer and currently 404.

Read design files with the `DesignSync` MCP (`get_file`). Images dropped into
`<image-slot>` elements are stored as base64 in `.image-slots.state.json`, not
as files — decode from there. Never push local changes back to that project
unless asked; the sync is one-way, design → code.

## Skills to invoke

Any change to layout, color, type, spacing, motion, or component states:

- **`ui-ux-pro-max`** first — run `--design-system` for direction, then
  `--domain ux` for the accessibility/interaction/animation checklists. Its
  §1–§3 (Accessibility, Touch & Interaction, Performance) are the pre-delivery
  gate for this repo.
- **`frontend-design`** for component craft and visual detail.
- **`webapp-testing`** to verify — screenshot at 1440 / 860 / 390 before
  calling anything done. There is no test suite; screenshots are the check.

Skip `ui-styling` unless the stack changes — it is Tailwind/shadcn/React
guidance and this site is vanilla CSS.

## Running it

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8777      # then open http://localhost:8777
```

## Conventions

**Tokens are three-layer and one-directional.** Primitives (`--ink-60`,
`--space-6`) → semantic (`--text-muted`, `--border-subtle`) → component
(`--nav-h`). Components reference semantic tokens only. Do not put a raw hex
or rgba in a component rule.

**Contrast is checked, not guessed.** Every ink alpha in the primitive layer
carries its measured ratio against the surface ramp in a comment. Body copy
sits at `--ink-60` or lighter (5.8:1 floor). `--ink-40` is for large bold text
only (3:1). Anything below that is non-text — rules and borders. If you add a
value, compute the ratio and record it.

**Motion shares one rhythm.** `--dur-fast` 200ms buttons, `--dur-base` 300ms
nav/surfaces, `--dur-slow` 800ms scroll entrances, `--stagger` 80ms between
siblings — all matching squarespace.com's timings. Transform and opacity
only, never width/height/top/left. Every motion rule needs a
`prefers-reduced-motion` escape.

**Touch targets are 44px minimum**, reached with padding or `min-height`, not
by growing the visible element.

**JS is optional by contract.** The page must read, navigate, and submit with
`main.js` removed. The `.js` class is added by the script itself, so any
hidden start state it introduces can only exist when something can undo it.

## Selected Work

There is no shipped client work yet, so the tiles hold six **concept
projects** — self-directed site designs in `concepts/`, each rendered to
`assets/img/work-<slug>.webp` and tagged `Concept` in the UI. Never present
someone else's site as work done here; if a tile becomes real client work,
swap the image, title, meta, and drop the tag.

| Slug | Business | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `botanica` | Floral studio | Fraunces italic on cream, deep green |
| `borough` | Barber shop | Oswald condensed on near-black, amber |
| `kettle` | Coffee roaster | Instrument Serif on sand, rust italic |
| `sunday` | Bakery | Bricolage Grotesque, butter/terracotta blocks |
| `meridian` | Architecture studio | Archivo only, visible column grid |
| `northline` | Bike shop | IBM Plex Mono specs, lime on slate |

Each is a different typeface and temperature on purpose — the set exists to
show range, so keep new ones distinct from all six.

**Render spec.** The tile is a 4:5 window (`.work__frame`) matching
squarespace.com's cards (measured 310×420 and 427×491, ratio 0.74–0.87).
The image inside is a **full-page** render — 1.4–1.8 screens tall — so
hovering can travel through it.

Shoot at a **900×1125** viewport with `full_page=True`, resize to **800px
wide** (height follows), save WebP q84. The first 1125px must stand alone as
the tile's resting state, since that is all a touch device ever sees. Write
the resulting pixel height into the tile's `height` attribute.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8777   # then screenshot concepts/<slug>.html
```

Give every concept enough below the fold to be worth scrolling — two
sections plus a closing band is the current shape. Design them to fill 4:5;
layouts built for a landscape viewport leave large voids when rendered tall.

**How the hover travel works.** `.work__frame` is `container-type: size`, so
the image moves by `translateY(calc(100cqh - 100%))` — exactly
(image height − frame height) at any breakpoint, no per-tile numbers. It is
gated on `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`: a touch device has no
way to reverse the state and would be stranded mid-scroll. Under
`prefers-reduced-motion` the travel is cancelled outright — the global reduce
rule only shortens the transition, which would snap the image to its end
position instead.

## Content still to fill

Two testimonial avatars and both quotes, and the about photo (currently
reusing the hero portrait). Forms post to `action="#"` — point them at a real
handler and delete the placeholder branch in `main.js`.

The hero portrait is 801px wide and gets upscaled ~1.8× at 1440px viewports.
A higher-resolution original is the single biggest visual win available.
